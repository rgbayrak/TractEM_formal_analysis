Analysis

61 pathways for each subject traced by at least 2 different raters. This created for 20 subjects (10 each from HCP and BLSA) 
40x61 total pathways. We assessed inter-rater reproducibility, and rater reproducibility. 

Inter-rater Analysis

Steps:

  1-Binarize the density images with th>0 and th>0.05
  2-Calculate similarity between rater(a) and rater(b) for same subject.
  3-Boxplot the 10 score points per dataset to assess reproducibility.

Intra-rater Analysis

This analysis is made in order to highlight the contribution of anatomical variation. 
The score is calculated by a similarity metric between each rater for a single fiber tracts for all 61 pathways.
r1-rn: r1r2 + ... + r(n-1)r(n)
